#### Difference from fork's origin:

1. The machine can now run 5 different sessions (including the original one). Except for the the original
   session that uses [frequency hopping](https://archive.md/leNZO#selection-1151.0-1151.493) for brainwave entrainment (aka the "chunky" method), the other 4 use smooth frequency transition (aka the "creamy" method), and are based on [Mindplace](https://mindplace.com/) [Proteus](http://mindplacesupport.com/proteus/) sessions (thanks to the admins and members of the mindplace [support forum](http://mindplacesupport.com/forum/) for all the attention and knowledge). There's a 10„èÄ potentiometer on pi A0 that is used to select the session.

1. Pin 2 (that used to be the "wake up button") now has 3 functions (depending on state): start / stop / wake (from sleep mode), and the button's interrupt is always attached (not only during sleep mode).

1. More serial debug prints (note that all serial related code is now
   inside `#ifdef DEBUG` blocks).

**Note:** you should download Bhagman's `Tone` library [here](https://github.com/bhagman/Tone#readme).

### New: mono (isochronic) variant

See `Arduino_Brain_Machine_Mono/` folder for code, and `arduino-brain-machine-mono*` for schematics.

    Derivation and Notes:
    Make sure you have dual wheel potentiometer to reduce
    the volume of the audio with your headset. If you don't, 
    you might damage your ear drums, your arduino or your headset.
    Add a 4.7K ohm resistor from each tone pin to each volume-in
    on the potentiometer to further reduce possibility of physical harm.
    
    This arduino sketch is based on the original Sound & Light Machine 
    by - Mitch Altman - 19-Mar-07 as featured in Make Magazine 10.

    See notes in code below for how I adapted Mitch Altman's version for Arduino
    
    The sleep coding comes partially from here:

    2011.02.20
    Fixed error in breadboard diagram. 
    Added new longer show and gamma frequency (40.4Hz).
    
    2011.02.15
    Added liability notice.
    
    2011.02.14
    Changed to switch/case format for stage choices.
    
    2011.02.14
    Added functions for alternating LED blinking for 
    each of the four stages. So now, there are 
    eight cases: b, B, a, A, t, T, d, and D.
    
    2011.02.14
    I've included a Stereo Eyephone Test sketch 
    and a Stereo Tone Test Sketch. These sketches are purely
    for development purposes, used to confirm preferred programming
    prior to putting it into the Arduino Brain Machine Sketch.
    
    If you're having trouble with Eyephones or Earphones, try
    isolating the cause using one of these simpler sketches.
